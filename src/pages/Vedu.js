        Hi tiw <br />
        Itâ€™s been 11 years since weâ€™ve been friends. Fuck man. Thatâ€™s a really
        long time. From junior school carpools in my momâ€™s khatara red swift ðŸš—
        when we played some game where ate crayons in the backseat to making a
        song on you being from bhiwadi to maintaining a friendship an ocean
        apart. Someone in ntu asked me other than family who do you think will
        be there first when you call them dying. I thought of you cus I know
        that thereâ€™s this unsaid understanding between us. Even if we donâ€™t talk
        everyday I know that I always have a friend, a supporter, a therapist
        and a free doctor in you. So many have walked in and out of this
        friendship but you and me have stayed strong. You've been a constant in
        my life for a long time and we've literally grown up together. I'm so
        proud of you for getting through these tough two years and I know that
        wherever you go you'll continue to make me very proud of everything you
        have and will become.
        <br />
        <br />I loved you when we were in class 2, I love you right now and I
        know Iâ€™ll love you way into the future whether weâ€™re in different
        countries, timezones etc. Happy birthday tiw/tewari/tew. I miss you and
        I promise weâ€™ll have the best time in December
